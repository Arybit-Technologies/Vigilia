Dear [NGO Leaderâ€™s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is [Your Name], and Iâ€™m reaching out on behalf of <strong>Vigilia</strong>, a mobile safety app designed to provide real-time emergency support at the tap of a button. Weâ€™re currently expanding our impact across communities, especially in high-risk areas, and your organizationâ€™s work in womenâ€™s safety and empowerment deeply aligns with our mission.

We would love to explore a <strong>partnership opportunity</strong> with [NGO Name] to:

âœ… Offer the app to your community members free of charge or at subsidized rates  
âœ… Co-create safety awareness campaigns (online & offline)  
âœ… Share impact data to support your ongoing safety programs

Would you be open to a quick 20-minute call next week to discuss how we can collaborate?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
